This assignment was finished on Visual studio windows 10 with opengl 4.6.


To control the spherical camera:
	Scroll wheel zooms in and out on the Sun or Earth
	Holding the right mouse button and dragging allows you to rotate the camera around the sphere
	Pressing the S key allows the camera to focus on the Sun
	Pressing the W key allows the camera to focus on the Earth

To control the animation:
	Pressing the R key allows the user to reset the animation
	Pressing the A key allows the user to slow down the animation
	Pressing the D key allows the user to speed up the animation


Bonus 1 was completed fully. (Bump mapping might be off honestly no idea)
	Wasn't sure if the cloud texture had to be applied on the night side of the earth so it is applied on the night side but can be removed by uncommenting line 143 on the fragment shader.


For bonus 2, the animation can be sped up and slowed down and the camera can be concentrated on the sun and on the earth as well.
